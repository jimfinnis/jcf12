A timesheet template can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet
[from this link](/downloads/AberworksTimesheet.xlsx).


When completing your timesheet:

* Insert the start and finish time in 24 hour clock format,
including the minutes e.g. start time 14:00 finish time 17:30.
* Only claim for work that has actually been completed
(you may work up to 15 hours per week) across all AberWorks roles.
* Students working on a Student Visa will only be able to work hours that remain compliant with their Visa.
* Submit your hours every month (by the required deadlines as noted below)
even if you have only worked a few hours that month.

* All timesheet claims must be confirmed and signed by the supervisor of
the module you are demonstrating for **before** being submitted for
processing **as an attached document via email only** to 
[gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk) by the deadline above.
* Any timesheets received after the deadline will not be processed until
the following month.
* Payment will be processed so that you will be paid on the last working day
of the month following the month you are submitting for.
* Avoid accumulating hours as this will have implications on the
amount of tax and National Insurance that you pay.
* Because the worksheets are submitted electronically, electronic signatures
are acceptable. 
* If you are printing out your timesheets to obtain signatures,
please make sure you send a scanned electronic copy only to
Glenwen - not the paper copy.

If you have any questions about timesheets, contact Glenwen
on [gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk).


## How this works in practice

Every slot in your timesheet has to be signed by a supervisor or you will
not be paid. This may be awkward for students who are doing slots in
multiple modules, but any process which gets a fully signed timesheet in
Glenwen's mailbox by the deadline is acceptable.

Possible options are:

* Email only - this is OK for one or two modules:
    * Email the timesheet to the supervisor for the first set of slots
    * get signed timesheet back,
    * email the timesheet to the supervisor for the second set of slots
    * get signed timesheet back 
    * repeat until all slots signed
    * email to Glenwen
* Put the timesheet on your [Onedrive](https://faqs.aber.ac.uk/?searchkeyword=OneDrive&amp;language=en)
and share a link with the supervisors. Once all slots are signed, email to Glenwen.
* Print out the timesheet, get all supervisors to sign, scan the signed timesheet and email to Glenwen
* Keep the timesheet on your laptop, get all supervisors to sign there, email to Glenwen.

We're aware that this situation is not ideal, but it's necessary. We're looking into alternatives but
may not be able to implement them until next year.
