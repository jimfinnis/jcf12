Changes from last year:

* You must create a separate timesheet for each module you demonstrate
* You must email the completed timesheets to the lecturer, not to Academic Operations (or anyone else)
**well before the deadline** if possible (to give them time to process it)

**This is an interim process while the Head of Academic Operations looks at
how timesheets should be handled in the longer term.**

A timesheet template can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet
[from this link](/downloads/AberworksTimesheet.xlsx).

When completing your timesheets:

* Keep a separate timesheet for each module you demonstrate.
* Add the supervisor's name (the lecturer) for each session.
* Insert the start and finish time in 24 hour clock format,
including the minutes e.g. start time 14:00 finish time 17:30.
* Only claim for work that has actually been completed
(you may work up to 15 hours per week) across all AberWorks roles.
* Students working on a Student Visa will only be able to work hours that remain compliant with their Visa.
* Submit your hours every month (by the required deadlines as noted below)
even if you have only worked a few hours that month.

* Send the time sheet **as an attached document via email only** to the supervisor **before**
the deadline above, to give them time to confirm it and send it on.
* Any timesheets received after the deadline will not be processed until
the following month.
* Payment will be processed so that you will be paid on the last working day
of the month following the month you are submitting for.
* Avoid accumulating hours as this will have implications on the
amount of tax and National Insurance that you pay.

If you have any questions about timesheets, contact Academic Operations
on [acadops@aber.ac.uk](mailto:acadops@aber.ac.uk). Remember to mark the email 
"AberWorks Demonstrator: Computer Science" (or your department).

We're aware that this process is not ideal, but it's necessary due to the limitations of shared mailboxes like
acadops@aber.ac.uk. We're looking into alternatives but may not be able to implement them until next year.
